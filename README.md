# FUN EXERCISE ABOUT CSS LAYOUT USING FLAGS

*Funny project aimed to show a specific flags layout using only FLEX containers within CSS*
*Requirements to accomplish for the challenge:*
    *-Layout 100% developed using FLEXBOX framework*
    *-"Margin" property is NOT allowed under any circumstance*
    *-"Wrap" property will be used ,at least, once w/flex*


### Deployment

Just copy and paste the full folder structure inside your */public* hosting server hard drive / ftp folder and it will run!

### HTML Notes üìã

I've tried to keep as clean as possible the basic elements.
Due the exercise requirements <Header> <Nav> and <footer> sections have been avoided
Width for the content <screen-size> has been setup to 800 px.


### CSS Notes üìã

A *Custom Colour Palette* has been created to quickly setup flags colors trought the layout.
I've divided the CSS code in sections and I've followed the same procedure as in HTML;
-General rule style for resetting the browser
-Specific style rules to format DIVs container's nested structured
-Specific styles for specific flag's stuff.

This way the code becomes more clean and it's easier to brownse while editing in Visual Studio.
